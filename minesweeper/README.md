# Minesweeper Game

I took a programming quiz early on during my job search at http://www.triplebyte.com.  I was not ready to pursue programming full time, so I didn't follow up more, but it was good food for thought.

At https://triplebyte.com/static/interview_guide_2h_v2, they had this section.

## Programming

In this section, we ask you to write a game in the console. This will be text-based (no graphics). We recommend that you make sure you're comfortable reading input (strings and numbers) from the console, and writing output to the console. If you would like a practice problem, implementing Minesweeper in the console would be a good one.
