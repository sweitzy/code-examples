# Code Examples For Interviews

Interviewing in 2017 is quite a bit different from 2001, the last time I did it.  Even for QA Manager, recruiters ask programming questions.

After being in QA only for so long, it feels like getting back closer to development would be interesting again and a good career move.

I hope these examples help spark others to ramp up or ramp back up their development skills.

## Learn and Use Github

I started using RCS in 1986 and still use it for controlling /etc files.  I have used CVS since it first came out, but it does not scale well.  SVN is better but still does not scale very well (Cisco had to switch to a WAN implementation to SVN for SJC/BLR usage, but that version seemed to have constant problems).  Git has an interesting history that is an entertaining read, and it intentionally does not work like CVS/SVN.  This has made it a little harder to get used to for me.

Github is free if you are willing to have all your files visible to everyone.  Your github will also show up in Google searches, which I wanted.

Take some time writing .mk Markdown files.

## Spend Some Time Programming

When I started my career, the best place to learn was at the Computer Literacy bookstores.  Now everything is online, but I still like buying books sometimes.  But I haven't needed to buy books or take online courses to get ramped up on new languages.

The Python online tutorial is good.  The Go online tutorial is even better.

## Get a Free AWS Account

Just like github is free, AWS offers a free tier for one year.  I was able to get a RHEL VM running in less than 5 minutes, although the VM creation wizard did not configure firewall correctly.   These VMs are great places to run your new code.
